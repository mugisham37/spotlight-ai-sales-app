1. WHEN users access protected routes THEN the system SHALL verify authentication before allowing access
2. WHEN authentication fails on protected routes THEN the system SHALL redirect to the sign-in page
3. WHEN API routes are accessed THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate security headers
4. WHEN webhook endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL verify signatures and validate requests
5. IF rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
6. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log security events

### Requirement 5: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**User Story:** As an application administrator, I want to control user permissions based on roles, so that different users have appropriate access levels to application features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is created THEN the system SHALL assign a default role
2. WHEN users access features THEN the system SHALL check their role permissions
3. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt
4. WHEN roles are updated THEN the system SHALL immediately apply new permissions
5. IF permission checks fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback to users
6. WHEN admin functions are accessed THEN the system SHALL verify admin role permissions

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer and system administrator, I want detailed error handling and logging throughout the authentication system, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with context
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive information to users
4. WHEN critical errors happen THEN the system SHALL alert administrators
5. IF logging fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating without crashing
6. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL log successful recovery

### Requirement 7: User Experience and Loading States

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth loading states and clear feedback during authentication processes, so that I understand what's happening and feel confident the system is working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators
2. WHEN pages are loading THEN the system SHALL show skeleton screens or spinners
3. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL provide success feedback
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages
5. IF network issues occur THEN the system SHALL show appropriate retry options
6. WHEN users navigate THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions

### Requirement 8: Session Management and Security

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want secure session management with appropriate timeouts and security measures, so that my account remains protected even if I forget to log out.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users sign in THEN the system SHALL create secure sessions with appropriate expiration
2. WHEN sessions expire THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect to sign-in
3. WHEN users are inactive THEN the system SHALL warn before session timeout
4. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
5. IF multiple sessions exist THEN the system SHALL allow users to manage active sessions
6. WHEN users sign out THEN the system SHALL properly clear all session data

### Requirement 9: Multi-Factor Authentication Support

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the option to enable multi-factor authentication, so that my account has an additional layer of security protection.

#### Acceptance Criteria
